# spring-jwt-auth

# INTRODUCTION
This project is one of the projects that I am following as part of my springboot up-skilling.  It is as the name explains,  Json Web Token (JWT) authentication.  It is part of the series I am following from [bezkoder](https://www.bezkoder.com/spring-boot-jwt-authentication/) .  

# MORE
this includes a vuejs frontend which I am still reading up on so that I will know what I am doing. As soon as I am done with it I'll try to use docker to make sure that I integrate the two projects and I will be adding unit tests.   

My Idea is to include basic unit tests for every Java project that I'll be doing.  **Wish me luck**
